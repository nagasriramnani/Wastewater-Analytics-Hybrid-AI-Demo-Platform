4. Scenario Analysis:
   - Adjust flow, temperature, aeration sliders
   - See adjusted forecast

### üö® Anomaly Detection Center

**Purpose**: Identify outliers and anomalies

**Workflow**:
1. Select target variable
2. Choose detection method:
   - Z-score (default)
   - IQR (Interquartile Range)

3. Set threshold (1.0-5.0)

4. Detect anomalies:
   - View timeline with anomalies highlighted
   - Review anomaly table
   - Analyze root causes

### üîç Explainability Lab

**Purpose**: Understand model predictions

**Features**:
- Global feature importance
- SHAP explanations (for LightGBM)
- Partial Dependence Plots
- What-If Analysis

**Workflow**:
1. Select trained model
2. View feature importance charts
3. For LightGBM: See SHAP summary plots
4. Generate PDP for specific features
5. Use What-If to test scenarios

### üìà Benchmarking Suite

**Purpose**: Compare performance across sites

**Workflow**:
1. Select sites to compare
2. Choose metrics for benchmarking
3. Generate benchmark:
   - View comparison table
   - See radar chart
   - Period-over-period analysis

### üßæ Reporting

**Purpose**: Generate professional reports

**Workflow**:
1. Configure report:
   - Title, subtitle, author
   - Output format (PDF/PPTX/HTML)
   - Sections to include

2. Generate report:
   - Click "Generate Report"
   - Download when ready

## Tips & Best Practices

### Data Preparation

- Ensure date column is parseable (YYYY-MM-DD format preferred)
- Remove extreme outliers before training
- Ensure target column has <10% missing values

### Model Training

- Start with sample data to test workflow
- Use "Max Rows" limit for faster demos
- Compare multiple models before selecting best

### Forecasting

- Longer horizons (90+ days) work best with Prophet
- Shorter horizons (7-30 days) work well with LightGBM
- Use scenario analysis for planning

### Anomaly Detection

- Start with default threshold (3.0)
- Review anomalies manually before taking action
- Use root-cause analysis to understand why

### Reporting

- Include all relevant sections for comprehensive reports
- Charts are embedded in PDF/PPTX
- HTML reports are interactive

## Troubleshooting

### Model Training Fails

- **Check**: Target column has sufficient data
- **Check**: Date column is correctly parsed
- **Solution**: Reduce max rows or fix data issues

### Forecasts Look Wrong

- **Check**: Model was trained on similar data
- **Check**: Forecast horizon is reasonable
- **Solution**: Retrain with more data

### Reports Won't Generate

- **Check**: `reports/` directory exists
- **Check**: Write permissions
- **Solution**: Create directory manually if needed
