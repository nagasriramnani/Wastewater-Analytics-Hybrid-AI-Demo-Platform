# ✅ Forecasting Feature Mismatch - FIXED

## Problem

The forecasting page was failing with:
```
Forecast generation failed: The feature names should match those that were passed during fit.
Feature names unseen at fit time: DQO_E, Q_E
Feature names seen at fit time, yet now missing: DQO_E_lag_1, DQO_E_lag_2, ...
```

## Root Cause

1. **During Training**: Models are trained with engineered features (lags, rolling means, etc.)
   - Example: `DQO_E_lag_1`, `DQO_E_lag_2`, `DQO_E_rolling_mean_7`, etc.

2. **During Forecasting**: The code was trying to use raw column names
   - Example: `DQO_E`, `Q_E`

3. **Mismatch**: Models expect engineered features but received raw features → Error

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Store Training Metadata
- Modified `training_studio.py` to store `feature_names`, `date_col`, `site_col`, and `target_col` in `st.session_state.training_metadata`

### 2. Feature Engineering During Forecasting
- Modified `forecasting.py` to:
  - Check for training metadata
  - Use `FeatureFactory` to build the same features used during training
  - Align feature columns with model expectations
  - Handle missing features gracefully (fill with 0)

### 3. Fallback Logic
- If feature engineering fails → Use simple extrapolation
- If no training metadata → Use simple extrapolation
- For Prophet models → Use Prophet's native forecast method (works with raw time series)

## How It Works Now

1. **Training Phase**:
   ```
   User trains model → FeatureFactory creates features → Model trained → Metadata stored
   ```

2. **Forecasting Phase**:
   ```
   User requests forecast → Load training metadata → FeatureFactory creates same features → 
   Align columns → Model.predict() → Extrapolate for horizon → Display forecast
   ```

## Files Modified

1. `app/ui/pages/training_studio.py`
   - Store `feature_names` in model metadata
   - Store training metadata in `st.session_state.training_metadata`

2. `app/ui/pages/forecasting.py`
   - Added imports: `DataIngestionEngine`, `FeatureFactory`
   - Check for training metadata
   - Build features using same factory settings
   - Align feature columns with model
   - Graceful fallback to extrapolation

## Usage

### Step 1: Train Models
1. Go to **AI Training Studio**
2. Load dataset and select target
3. Train models
4. Feature names are automatically stored

### Step 2: Generate Forecast
1. Go to **Forecasting Hub**
2. Select trained model
3. Select target variable (same as training)
4. Click **"Generate Forecast"**
5. System will:
   - Load training metadata
   - Build same features
   - Generate forecast ✅

## Error Prevention

- ✅ Feature names matched between training and forecasting
- ✅ Missing features handled (filled with 0)
- ✅ Fallback to simple extrapolation if feature engineering fails
- ✅ Prophet models work with raw time series data
